## Set Up
This is a Node app so you'll need Node and NPM to get it up on its feet.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```


Now open `client/index.html` or use link in terminal

## Quest
- [x] Create a repo (ideally on github) and make a `init` commit
- [x] Commit often, with high quality comments
- [x] Write readable, performant code
- [x] Fix all the bugs
- [x] Add a feature that allows users to complete tasks
- [x] Add a feature that allows users to delete tasks
- [x] Add a feature that allows the completion of all tasks
- [x] Add a feature that allows the deletion of all tasks
- [x] Add caching to the client app so that when we lose our connection we can still see our TODO's
- [x] Give it some UX/UI :heart:, our approach is make it easy to use- _then_ make it beautiful
